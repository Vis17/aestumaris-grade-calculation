# AESTUMARIS - Grade Calculation

AESTUMARIS is a little tool to calculate grades based on the points, reached in a classtest.

I started this project because it was (_really_) boring during school lessons and so I had something to do. So just donÂ´t expect this to be a great project ðŸ¦Ž.

## Setup

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# build the app
npm run build

# check the project with svelte-check
npm run check
```

## Libraries

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) are used for the UI
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is used to build the app
